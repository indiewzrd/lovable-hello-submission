# Stakedriven Implementation Summary

## Overview
Stakedriven is a Web3 platform for creating fundable polls where users vote with USDC on-chain. The platform combines smart contracts on Base Sepolia with a Next.js web application.

## Smart Contracts (Deployed on Base Sepolia)

### 1. PollFactory Contract
- **Address**: `0xbAd1412E9F40ec01055f2CF7439c1391dF4373b6`
- **Features**:
  - Deploy individual poll contracts
  - Global admin controls
  - Fee management (5% platform fee)
  - Rescue wallet for emergency fund recovery

### 2. Poll Contract
- **Features**:
  - Vote with USDC tokens
  - Cancel and re-vote functionality
  - Automatic winner calculation
  - Claim mechanisms for creators and voters
  - Non-winning vote refunds

### 3. USDC Integration
- **Base Sepolia USDC**: `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`
- Approval flow implemented for voting

## Web Application Features

### 1. Authentication
- Privy.io integration for wallet connection
- Support for multiple wallet providers
- Automatic user creation on first login

### 2. Poll Creation
- Multi-step form with validation
- Deploys smart contract on-chain
- Saves metadata to PostgreSQL database
- Options for:
  - Question and description
  - Multiple choice options
  - USDC amount per vote
  - Number of winning options
  - Start and end times

### 3. Voting Interface
- Real-time voting results display
- USDC approval flow
- Transaction status tracking
- Visual progress indicators
- Option selection with descriptions

### 4. Claiming System
- Automatic winner calculation after poll ends
- Creator can claim winning funds (minus 5% fee)
- Non-winning voters can claim refunds
- Fee wallet can claim platform fees
- Transaction history tracking

### 5. Database Schema
- **Users**: Wallet addresses and profiles
- **Projects**: Container for polls
- **Polls**: Metadata and contract addresses
- **Votes**: On-chain voting records
- **Claims**: Refund and reward tracking

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Wagmi for Web3 interactions
- Shadcn UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Backend
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Server Actions for data mutations
- API routes for data fetching
- Supabase for database hosting

### Smart Contract Development
- Solidity 0.8.24
- Hardhat development framework
- OpenZeppelin contracts
- Comprehensive test suite

## Key Files and Directories

### Smart Contracts
- `/contracts/PollFactory.sol` - Factory contract
- `/contracts/Poll.sol` - Individual poll contract
- `/scripts/deploy-*.js` - Deployment scripts
- `/scripts/test-*.js` - Testing scripts

### Web Application
- `/app/dashboard/polls/create` - Poll creation page
- `/app/polls/[id]` - Poll voting page
- `/app/explore` - Browse all polls
- `/lib/contracts/` - Contract ABIs and hooks
- `/components/polls/` - Poll-specific components

### Configuration
- `/lib/contracts/config.ts` - Contract addresses
- `/lib/contracts/hooks.ts` - React hooks for contracts
- `/db/schema.ts` - Database schema

## Testing

### Smart Contract Tests
1. **Local Testing** (`scripts/deploy-and-test-local.js`)
   - Mock USDC deployment
   - Full voting flow simulation
   - Claiming mechanisms

2. **Base Sepolia Testing** (`scripts/test-voting-flow.js`)
   - Real USDC integration
   - Multi-voter scenarios
   - Edge case testing

3. **Existing Poll Testing** (`scripts/test-existing-poll.js`)
   - Check poll status
   - View voting results
   - Monitor claims

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Create a project
- [x] Deploy a poll contract
- [x] View poll on explore page
- [x] Approve USDC for voting
- [x] Submit a vote
- [x] Cancel and re-vote
- [x] View real-time results
- [x] Calculate winners after poll ends
- [x] Claim creator rewards
- [x] Claim voter refunds

## Deployed Test Polls

1. **Poll 1**: `0x6c7df28498ee5040d41fe23b2278ab8ec70d3adc`
   - Duration: 1 hour (short for testing)
   - Status: Likely ended

2. **Poll 2**: `0x1304eCA44ab5fe10B4D7510C0F4e0C056A643D43`
   - Duration: 1 hour
   - 5 USDC per vote
   - 4 options, 2 winners

## Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy to Base mainnet
   - Update contract addresses
   - Enable production database

2. **UI Enhancements**
   - Add poll categories
   - Implement search and filters
   - Add user profiles
   - Create analytics dashboard

3. **Smart Contract Upgrades**
   - Add quadratic voting option
   - Implement delegation
   - Support multiple tokens
   - Add time-weighted voting

4. **Testing**
   - Add e2e tests with Playwright
   - Implement contract monitoring
   - Add performance testing
   - Create load testing suite

## Security Considerations

1. **Smart Contracts**
   - All funds held in individual poll contracts
   - Admin functions limited to configuration
   - Rescue function for emergency recovery
   - No upgradeable contracts (immutable)

2. **Web Application**
   - Server-side validation
   - Rate limiting on API routes
   - Secure wallet connection
   - Environment variable protection

## Known Issues

1. **USDC Availability**: Base Sepolia USDC faucet may be limited
2. **Gas Costs**: Poll deployment requires ~0.02 ETH
3. **Event Parsing**: Poll address extraction from events needs improvement
4. **Mobile UI**: Needs responsive design improvements
