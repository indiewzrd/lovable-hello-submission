# Stakedriven - Web3 Fundable Polls Platform

A web3 platform where communities can create polls to vote and fund features with on-chain funds. Voters use USDC to vote on options, and winning funds go to the poll creator.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

4. Configure your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   # Required
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID=your-privy-app-id
   
   # Already configured for Base Sepolia
   NEXT_PUBLIC_POLL_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0xbAd1412E9F40ec01055f2CF7439c1391dF4373b6
   NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC_ADDRESS=0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e
   ```

5. Push database schema:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit push
   ```

6. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployment
